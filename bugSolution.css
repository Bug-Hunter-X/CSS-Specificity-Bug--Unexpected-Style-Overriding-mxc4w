Several approaches can address this issue:

1. **Increase Specificity of Intended Style:**  Make the intended style more specific. For example, if you want `.special` to take precedence, you could increase its specificity by making it even more detailed.

2. **Use !important:** Use the `!important` flag. *However, this is generally discouraged as it makes maintenance difficult.*  Only use it as a last resort.

3. **CSS Preprocessors:**  Utilize a CSS preprocessor such as Sass or Less. These allow for features like nesting and variables, improving code organization and making specificity issues easier to manage.

4. **Re-order your CSS:** Sometimes reordering CSS to ensure your desired selectors are lower in the stylesheet will help, but this is not ideal.

**Example (using more specific selector in bugSolution.css):**

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red !important; /* Using !important, not ideal but demonstrates the effect */
}

.special div {
  color: green; 
}
```

This revised code will render the text red, showcasing the intended effect.
