The CSS specificity rules can lead to unexpected styling issues.  For example, consider this scenario:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: red;
}

.special div {
  color: green; 
}

<div class="special"></div>
```

Intuitively, one might expect the text to be red because of the `class="special"`.  However, the more specific selector `.special div` overrides it, resulting in green text. This can be difficult to debug, especially in large CSS files with many overlapping rules.
